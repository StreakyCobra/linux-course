This document is the transcript of my Linux course. It provides a summary of all important informations transmitted during the course. It does not pretend to be exhaustive, nor containing all informations given during the course. It is more like a reminder of all presented subjects.

The first part, <<part:fundamentals,Fundamentals>>, introduce some fundamental concepts of linux: Files, Folders, Processes, Users and Groups. A part about the <<part:shell,Shell>> follows and gives informations on how to use the shell efficiently. Some important pieces of the linux environment are then presented in the <<part:environment,Environment>> part. Finally, <<part:others,Others>> regroups several topics, either more advanced or not fitting into others chapters. At the end of this document, a glossary is provided to help navigating it.
